# Pair Programming Exercises: Jessih Strikes Back

Welcome to a series of exercises designed to challenge your understanding of basic programming concepts and test your problem-solving skills in JavaScript. In this set of problems, weâ€™ll follow a narrative involving Jessih and her quest that requires you to apply your knowledge of arrays, strings, and algorithms.

## Introduction to Testing

Before you dive into the problems, let's talk about testing. Testing in software development is the practice of running scripts called "tests" that ensure your code functions as expected. It's like proofreading an essay but for code. In these exercises, you'll write functions that we'll later validate through tests using a framework called Jasmine. Testing helps us catch errors before they occur in a real-world scenario and ensures that any future changes we make to the code won't break existing functionality.

## Problems Overview

### 1) Brute Force Attack

You need to help Jessih figure out if the list of potential passwords she has includes the actual password to an Instagram account. Your function will receive an array of strings and a single string representing the real password and should return a boolean indicating whether the real password is in the array.

### 2) The Blackberry

Jessih has come across an old mobile device and wants to access its messages. The device is protected by a numeric PIN that is exactly four digits long, with the first digit not being zero. Write a function to generate all possible PINs that meet this criteria.

### 3) Mails

Jessih remembers that there were many "professional emails" exchanged and now needs access to an email account. Given a list of email usernames, write a function to return an array of complete email addresses with the domain "@gmail.com" appended to each username.

### 4) Decrypt Message

Amidst the investigation, Jessih found a strange object and a series of encrypted letters. It seems to be a set of rules for decrypting a ciphered message. Complete a function to iterate through the string and decrypt the message using the provided rules, returning the resulting string.

### 5) Infiltration

No messages were found on the device, but a suspicious document in the gmail account was uncovered. This document contains a list of words, one of which may be the password for the email account. Create a function to find the most frequently occurring word in this list.

### 6) Conclusions

After some digging, Jessih has found the most repeated word in the list. But what happened on February 14, 2023, when Izan, Jessih's ex, disappeared for 24 hours? Complete a function that retrieves the message property from an email sent by Izan on that specific date.

## Final Question

Who is Samantha?

## Bonus Challenge ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

For those looking for an extra challenge, there's a bonus problem: Given a string of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice. This is a link to the problem on LeetCode, where you can test your function against a suite of test cases: [First Letter to Appear Twice](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-letter-to-appear-twice/).

Dive into the exercises, implement the functions, and remember to test your code thoroughly to ensure accuracy. Good luck!
